# Getting Started

## Install and launch R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, 
               patchwork, 
               ggthemes, 
               hrbrthemes,
               ggrepel)
```
