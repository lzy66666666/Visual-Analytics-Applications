# Overview

The requirement of this exercise is to critic the submission of Singapore population pyramid from one of my classmate in terms of clarity and aesthetics, prepare a sketch for the alternative design by using the data visualisation design principles and best practices learned from Lesson 1 and 2. Eventually,I will remake the original design below by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages from R.

Original dashboard prepared could be retrieved through this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.hoang8154/viz/takehome1_16740523080150/Dashboard3). Below is a snapshot of the dashboard.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(knitr)
```

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Original Dashboard", fig.cap.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("G:/My Drive/SMU MITB/ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications/lzy66666666/Visual-Analytics-Applications/Take-home_Ex/Ex02/Img/Original_dashboard.PNG")
```

# Data Preparation

For this exercise, the data source remained the same as what was used in [exercise 01](Take-home_Ex/Ex01/Take-home_Ex01.html).

## Libraries to be used:
In this exercise, below are mainly libraries to be used:


```{r}
library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               ggplot2,
               ggrepel)
```

## Data loading:
