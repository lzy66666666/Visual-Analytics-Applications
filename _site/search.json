This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\n\npanel.cor <- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr <- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr <- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt <- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor <- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the major limitation of the correlation matrix is that the scatter plots appear very cluttered when the number of observations is relatively large (i.e. more than 500 observations).\nCorrgram data visualisation technique is able to overcome this problem, .\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\",\n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p < 0.05\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p < 0.05\"\n) \n\n\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\nTake note the sub-code chunk above can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\n\n\nFaceting is not available in ggcorrmat() but can be found in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\nTake note that:\n\nTo build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default visual object in corrplot used to plot the corrgram is circle.\nThe default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. We can switch in between “full”, “upper” and “lower” using parameter “type”.\nThe default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\nwine.cor <- cor(wine[, 1:11])\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nSome other parameters that can be changed to customise the layout such as: tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset.\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are: AOE, FPC, hclust and alphabet.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")"

Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.

    "text": "2.3 Interactive heatmap using heatmaply\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap. The text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Data transformation supported by heatmaply()\n\n2.3.1.1 Scaling method\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.2 Normalising method\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations. This preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”. Different from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n2.3.1.3 Percentising method\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank. This is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile. The benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it. Similar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Clustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n2.3.2.1 Manual approach\nUsing hierarchical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Statistical approach\nThe best clustering method and number of cluster would be determined using the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package.\n\nwh_d <- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust <- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k <- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nTherefore,\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can choose “GW” instead of “OLO”. GW aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option of ‘mean’ would give the output that is similar to what we would get from heatmap functions in other packages like gplots::heatmap.2\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” would give the dendrograms without any rotations that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Color palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Other cartographic advantages from heatmaply\nIn the code chunk below, some of following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot. - coord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1. - scale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\n3.6 Building Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nThe problem that I am trying to tackle is to build multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\n3.7 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, the followings steps should be considered:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attacks by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, I will extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n3.8 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: I will plot the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

    "text": "3 Data Visualisation\nAge-sex pyramid was taught be an analytical visualisation commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group.\n\n3.1 Overall Singaporean Population Pyramid\nTwo calculated fields are created to facilitate the visualisation preparation:\n    Male:\n    if [Sex]=\"Males\"\n    then [Population]\n    end\n    \n    Female:\n    if [Sex]=\"Females\"\n    then [Population]\n    end\nTo produce the desired visualisation, follow below steps:\n\nDrag the ‘Age Group’ from Data panel into Rows bar.\nSort the ‘Age Group’ by clicking the white downwards pointing arrow, choose ‘Sort’ and sort by ‘Alphabetic’ in descending order.\nDrag the line item ‘5_to_9’ inside the worksheet from ‘Age Group’ column to one line above ‘0_to_4’. With this, the age group should have been sorted in a descending manner entirely.\nDrag the ‘Population’ from Data panel into Columns bar twice. Two ‘SUM(Population)’ should be seen in Columns’ bar. This step is to facilitate the pyramid making. Whereby the left side will be intended to use for female population visualisation and the right side will be intended to use to male population visualisation.\nRight click the axis of the ‘Population’ on the left and edit axis. Choose the option of ‘Reversed’ under ‘Scale’. This will reverse the axis on the left. Rename the axis on the left to ‘Female’.\nRight click the axis on the right. Edit the axis and rename it to ‘Male’.\n\nThere is a pyramid shape built now. Proceeding next to isolate each gender’s population from the other.\n\nCreate two newly calculated measures named ‘Male Color’ and ‘Female Color’. This is to facilitate the visualisation of pyramid later.\nMale Color: \nstr(if [Sex]=\"Males\" \nthen 1 \nelse 0 \nend)\n\nFemale Color: \nstr(if [Sex]=\"Females\" \nthen 1 \nelse 0 \nend)\nDrag the ‘Female Color’ from Data panel into Marks section under the ‘Color’ button from the first ‘SUM(Population)’. Choose a color that you would like to assign to Female population data (1). Here, color pink is used. When the data is not ‘Female’ (0), color grey is used.\nSimilarly, drag the ‘Male Color’ from Data panel and do the same but put it under under the second ‘SUM(Population)’. Choose a color that you would like to assign to Male population data (1). Here, color blue is used. When the data is not ‘Male’ (0), color grey is used to align with the color used in ‘Female Color’.\nFor better analysis usage, under ‘Marks’ section for both ‘SUM(Population)’, ‘Allow labels to overlap other marks’ is chosen under ‘Label’. This will enable us to see all population data on the chart.\nChoose ‘Entire View’ on the top menu to allow bigger chart being presented when in full screen mode.\nRename the tab with an informative title.\n\nTherefore, a population pyramid of Singapore has been completed. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation pyramid of Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Selection of Nine Planning Areas\nFor this take-home exercise, nine planning areas are supposed to be chosen and presented on a single view.\nTo find out which nine areas to work on, it’s more of my interest to filter based on each of their total population. Below actions are taken in order to achieve that.\n\nCreate a new worksheet.\nDrag the ‘Population’ values from Data panel into Columns bar.\nDrag the ‘Planning Area’ text from Data panel into Rows bar.\nSort the ‘Planning Area’ by clicking the white downwards pointing arrow, choose ‘Sort’ and sort by ‘Field’ in descending order. Choose the field to be sorted by ‘Population’ from the drop-down list. The aggregation we use here remains ‘Sum’.\n\nThis would enable us to visualise the top planning areas according to each of their total area population. To make the list of top area more clearly, parameters and additional calculated fields are created.\nCreation of parameter ‘Top Planning Areas’.\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter: Top planning area\n\n\n\n\nCreation of set ‘Top N Planning Area’ derived from item ‘Planning Area’ from the Data panel by right clicking it:\n\n\n\n\n\nSet: Top N Planning Area\n\n\n\n\nCreation of calculated field ‘Labels’. This label is to be displayed inside the table later for easier readability.\n    if [Top N Planning Area]\n    then \"Top \" + str([Top Planning Area]) + \" Planning Areas\"\n    else \"Others\"\n    end\nWith these, below chart is completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 9 planning area by total population\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, the nine areas that are chosen to study on are:\n\nBedok,\nTampines,\nJurong West,\nSengkang,\nWoodlands,\nHougang,\nYishun,\nChoa Chu Kang,\nPunggol.\n\n\n\n3.3 Trellis Display of Population Pyramid of The Nine Planning Areas\nIn this exercise, the nine planning areas are requested to be presented on a single view. To do that, a trellis display will be applied. Following below steps that will lead us to the desired output.\n\nDuplicate the worksheet ‘PA comparison of Female and Male population in Singapore broken down by age group 2022’.\nRename the worksheet to ‘Trellis comparison of Female and Male population in Top 9 Population Areas of Singapore broken down by age group 2022’.\nDrag the ‘Planning Area’ text from Data panel into Columns bar.\nDrag the ‘Planning Area’ text from Data panel into Filters section and tick the chosen nine areas only.\n\nThe trellis display is therefore completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 9 planning area population pyramid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Final Dashboard\nThe final dashboard is produced by putting together the three important worksheets. Here, three worksheets have been chosen to present together in one view to complete the whole story.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 9 planning area population pyramid"

    "text": "4 Observation and Insights\nThis part is the write-up requested. Words count: 447 words.\n\n4.1 “Constrictive” pyramid (or “negative growth” pyramid)\nThe population pyramid of Singapore observed from the figure above is narrowed at the bottom younger ages, typical for many developed countries in the world. Usually, country of this population pyramid type tends to have a lower birth rate and a lower death rate thanks to prevalent high level of education and accessible health care services.\nThis observation is in line with many incentive measures from the government seen, for example, policies like birth bonuses, child benefits and even tax credits.\n\n\n4.2 The population pyramid of Singapore from 2022 remains like the one from 2017.\nFrom this link shared by prof, the population pyramid of Singapore in 2022 still look very alike in how it was in 2017, despite of much effort from government on improving fertility rate.\nThis is indeed a concerning topic. Such constrictive pyramid indicates a higher dependency ratio (a ratio related to the number of children and older persons to the working-age population), which implies potential work force shortage in the future. Consequentely, that might result in seriously negative economic impact like reduction in taxation and heavier burden on health care industry.\n\n\n4.3 Females outnumber males in Singapore Based on June 2022 data.\nThis trend is observed in majority age groups. Zooming into each group, only for age 19 and below, number of males is observed to be higher. This trend is observed in majority age groups. Zooming into each group, only for age 19 and below, number of males is observed to be higher. The trend also applies to the nine areas that we have chosen to study on. Without more than sufficient research, there are some unproved personal assumptions that might lead to this result:\n\nMales tend to have a higher mortality rate especially at an older age group, mainly due to higher probability of possessing an unhealthy life habit like smoking or heavy drinking.\nA possible relatively higher rate of approval for immigration applications from foreign young females. This might account for some partial efforts from government on improving the fertility rate of Singapore.\n\n\n\n4.4 Punggol and Sengkang each has slightly different population pyramid from the rest of chosen areas’.\nThanks to the Trellis plot, a comparison between the nine areas looks much easier. From the dashboard, Punggol and Sengkang seem to have a relatively larger base (newly born babies) and middle part (working adults) than the rest. This observation tends to prove the point of view that these two areas tend to have higher percentages of young working couples and babies. Hence, Punggol has recently been dubbed as Singapore’s baby town, according to a news report from The Straits Times."

The tableau public dashboard, however, is published using the name of ‘Singapore Population distribution by age’. Misunderstanding might be raised as people might wrongly conclude that there are only nine areas in total in Singapore, based on this dashboard.\n\n\n2.1.2 Misalignment in x-axis across nine plots\nFor the chosen nine areas’ plots, some different scales are observed in the x-axis (population count). Misleading visual representation originated from the graph might result in wrong conclusion being made.\n\n\n2.1.3 Weak analytics capabilities\nDespite the pyramid shape of each of the nine areas has been plotted, the dashboard seems to be short of analytics capabilities overall.

Across the five continents, an upward trend is observed from 2020 to 2022, as seen in Figure 1\nii. The bulky portion of Singapore’s bi-lateral trade comes from Asia. According to Figure 3,\n\nMainland China is undoubtedly the biggest contributor.\nMalaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia are the rest of top 5 trade partners from Asia.\n\niii. Trade deficit is constantly observed from Singapore’s partnership with Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan, while a consistent surplus is observed from the trade partnership with Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, using the color from Figure 2\niv. The trade volume is rather consistent throughout the year for different months, with the exception of February, in which a lower value is observed for most Asian selected countries in all three years. This could be largely due to two main reasons:\n\nThere are usually less number of days in the calendar month of February.\nMost of Chinese New Year holidays fall in the month of February, both sides’ work and operations could be in a slower pace as compared to the rest of months."
